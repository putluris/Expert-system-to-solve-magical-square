# Expert-system-to-solve-magical-square
I found the magic square a simple problem with a very rich combinatorics: There are (n2 )! Manners to fill the nxn matrix with integers 
between 1 and n2, without repetitions, but only very few of them are magic square. For n=4, generating all the 16! Permutations, I found 7040 
magic squares and 549504 relaxed magic squares. In the literature many people believe that the number of magic squares of order four is 880,but 
infact these are the canonical magic squares from which can be generated all the other by rotation and transposition or reflection. So I use the 
magic square as a bench mark to compare mathematical programming, namely mixed inter programming[MIP],with genetic algorithm(GAs),that I will show 
are much more powerful to solve these kind of discrete combinational explosive problems. This game could be used for management training since in 
management problems I often have a limited budget, a lot of constraints and objectives to reach that could be formulated in a similar matrix form. 
Finally I developed, an artificial intelligence minimax algorithm that imitates a human solving the magic square and show that in most cases its 
performance, in terms of number permutations, is better than the performance of the GA algorithm.
